TO DO
=====

- Download the latest version of multiple choice!
- left align options in translation task

- Create a version of norming task without multiple choice; instead participants say a translation which we record
- Include feedback in the verb translation? Just to keep participants motivated? (but note that won't be possible if it's oral translation...)
