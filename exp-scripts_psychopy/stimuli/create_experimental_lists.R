## Script to generate experimental lists from the list of target verbs

# NB: Script is written to be sourced from the Rproject in the root directory
# of the project. All paths are relative to that root! (I.e., things will not
# work if script is called from the folder where it is actually located.)

getwd()  # should be "[whatever...]/2018_replication_sheb-pulv2013"

#  Load data and process

sum(table(tv$verb) != 1)  # Check no repeated verbs (value has to be zero!)
table(tv$type) %% 4 == 0  # Check number of arm/leg verbs are multiples of 4 (both TRUE)

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# An item consists of a set of 4 words of the same type, independent of the
# order in which these 4 words are shown. Note that items are fixed in this
# study so as to make it possible to account for item-variability in the
# analyses.

# Presentation of items is randomized at two levels and with certain constraints:
# Level 1: In each block, the order of the 4 words that form an item is shuffled.
# (this means the item has the same words, but in different orders between blocks.)
# Level 2: The sequence of items presented in a block is random "with the 
# constraint that not more than three trials of the same word category appeared
# consecutively." (Shebani & PulvermÃ¼ller, 2013:225)
