TO DO's and questions regarding implementation of the Shebani & PulvermÃ¼ller paradigm
================================================================================

## Presentation of words:

- font?
- all capital? first capital  --> lowercase


## Choice of words

- Target verbs
- Training verbs


## Create pseudo random presentation lists

- What list of items created?
- How are these lists shown?
- not more than 3 trials of same category after one another
- How are random lists selected? Presumably based on subject number


## Save data after every trial 

If Python crashes in the middle of the experiment, all data is lost. This hurts if it happens at the end of the experiment. See suggestion by Chuck Theobald in the following link to prevent losing all data:

Check with Gunnar as well...


## Sound recording

- Check it works on project cpu


## Training phase

- "Train now" and "Ready - press space bar" as 2 separate slides
- Increase to 5-6 items (20-24 words)
- Before starting: "remember the memory phase starts after the 4th word is presented"


## Other

- General instructions in the beginning
- "fixation point": is this an actual point or perhaps a crosshair? What size? --> careful how size is defined if it's relative to the current monitor!


## Pilot

- Length of presentation: 100 ms enough?
- Length of beep (current 250 ms)
