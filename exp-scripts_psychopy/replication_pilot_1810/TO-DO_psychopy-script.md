TO DO (sheb_replication_1810.psyexp)
===================================

Higher prio
===========

## Script structure

- Check and clean up the global variables set in the code snippet at the beginning of experiment


## Choice of words/stimuli

- There's only a preliminary quick-and-dirty choice of English verbs --> Come up with final selection
- Selection of Swedish verbs?


## Create presentation lists with final set of target verbs

Is working now, but needs to be adjusted once we have final item lists (training + target); this choice will be based on our norming tasks in the pilot.


## Instructions to RAs are inconsistent (see team_instructions)

Go through them and perhaps merge?


## Power analysis to determine N


Lower prio
============

## Simplify output data file

Remove unnecessary (uninformative) columns in generated data files?
