TO DO (sheb_replication_1810.psyexp)
===================================

Higher prio
===========

## Script structure

- Session (constrained to 1 or 2 -- or 9 for speeded v) has to determine order of hand/feet blocks
	--> Change the "conditions_block.csv" file to two different files called from the script depending on session
- Practice and target loops need to load data files from previously created files
- Check and clean up the global variables set in the code snippet at the beginning of experiment


## Adapt verb norming task for English natives


## Choice of words/stimuli

- There's only a preliminary quick-and-dirty choice of English verbs --> Come up with final selection
- Selection of Swedish verbs?


## Create presentation lists with final set of target verbs

Is working now, but needs to be adjusted once we have final item lists (training + target); this choice will be based on our norming tasks in the pilot.




Lower prio
============

## Simplify output data file

Remove unnecessary (uninformative) columns in generated data files?
