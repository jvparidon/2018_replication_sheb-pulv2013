Notes when running the experiment "sheb_replic.psyexp"
================================

## Use "session number = 9" (in startup dialogue) to speed through the task

This will set all the timing variables to very short durations, which allows us to run through the experiment waiting for the full 6 seconds of memory period and so on. Any other session number will have the default durations, which follow Shebani & Pulverm√ºller (2013).

## Use "participant number = 999" for testing

This is just a useful convention for ourselves. Besides, data files starting with "999" will be ignored from the git repository (see file ".gitignore")
