This is a partial replication and extension of the study reported in Shebani & Pulvermüller (2013).
We will use the same task with some minor methodological adjustments and test Swedish native L2 speakers of English.

The study will be pre-registered.


Description of repository
-------------------------

### Folder "exp-scripts_psychopy/" and subfolders

"exp-scripts_psychopy/" contains all files (scripts and conditions files) needed to run the experiment.

"exp-scripts_psychopy/data/" is automatically created by PsychoPy to store all the data created when running the experiment.

"exp-scripts_psychopy/stimuli/" contains the list of target verbs and R-scripts that will take those lists and generate randomized condition lists (under certain constraints, see the actual script).


### Rfunctions/

Contains R functions that I've factored out from scripts to gain clarity.
