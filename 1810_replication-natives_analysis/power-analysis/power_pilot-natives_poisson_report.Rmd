Introduction
============

This is a power analysis for a conceptual replication of Shebani & Pulvermüller
(2013, Cortex), henceforth S&P. In S&P, participants had to memorize groups of
four words (quadruples) that were either arm- or leg-related (word type). Each
block consisted of 24 such quadruples, 12 of each type. Between blocks they
manipulated the conditions under which the words had to be kept in memory. We
simplify their original design to a 2x2 within-subjects factorial design:

- *Movement*: arm or leg movement -- manipulated between blocks
- *WordType*: arm or leg verbs -- manipulated within blocks but between quadruples
(= trials)

We want to estimate the power for finding the most interesting effect reported
in S&P: An interaction of WordType (arm vs leg verb) and MovementType (arm vs
leg movements), leading to worse memory for arm than for leg verbs when
performing arm movements, and to worse memory for leg than for arm verbs when
performing leg movements.


Info provided in the paper
-------------

The dependent variable is the total number of errors made by a participant in
each of the four experimental cells defined by the 2-by-2 design.
The following table from the original paper summarizes the cell means, 
averaging over subjects.

Data set shared with us
--------------------

The first author shared the data file that went into the reported analyses,
but we have agreed not to share it. Here is *made up* data with the same
structure as the file we got:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
read.csv("madeup_data.csv") %>% head(., 9) %>% kable
```


Here is a plot of the *real* data showing cell means and confidence intervals
obtained from non-parametric bootstrapping (i.e., not assuming normality):

Power analyses
=============

The power analyses are done in the separate R-script 
`power-analysis_pilot_natives_poisson.R` (source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/montero-melis/2018_replication_sheb-pulv2013/blob/master/1810_replication-natives_analysis/power-analysis/power-analysis_pilot_natives_poisson.R)).

The analyses consist of the following steps:

1. Fit an appropriate Poisson generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to the
*original* data set.
2. Generate a large number of data sets from the distribution of coefficients
estimated by the model. This captures uncertainty in both the fixed effects
and the random effects part of the model.
3. Repeat step 2 for each set of parameters that we want to manipulate, namely
the size of the critical effect and the number of participants.
4. Fit an appropriate Poisson GLMM to each such data set.
5. Summarize, for each model, a test-statistic to decide whether the result
is significant or not.


Model fit to the original data
-----------------------------

Here is the summary of the model of the original data set; we use the parameter
estimates below in our power simulations:
