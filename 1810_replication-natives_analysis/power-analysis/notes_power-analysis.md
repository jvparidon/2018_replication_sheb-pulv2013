Notes on power analysis
=======================

TO DO
-----

### High prio

- Find out what to do about model convergence failures? --> Slack @Zach


### Low prio

- Changing when the fit_many function loads the saved object (towards the end), might save time?
- Replicate power analysis with binomial model?


Qs
---

- In LRT, comparing 2 models to test the significance of an interaction, how does
one specify the random effects structure? Always with interaction if possible?


Notes

Following thread might be of interest for generating overdispersed data from
a Poisson distribution:
