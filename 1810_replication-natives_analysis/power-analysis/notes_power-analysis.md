Notes on power analysis
=======================

Qs
---

- What to do about model convergence failures? (difficult to track them)
- What is a pragmatic approach?
- But how to choose the model, i.e. how to model the error data?
- I would prefer model based on binary data (per verb) bc it allows us to model
item (=verb) variability, which is not possible if we assume Normal or Poisson...
- In LRT, comparing 2 models to test the significance of an interaction, how does
one specify the random effects structure? Always with interaction if possible?

Following thread might be of interest for generating overdispersed data from
a Poisson distribution:
