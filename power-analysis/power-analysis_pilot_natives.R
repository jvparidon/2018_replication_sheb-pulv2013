## Power analysis for pilot study: a conceptual replication of Shebani & 
## Pulverm√ºller (2013, Cortex), henceforth S&P

# We will try to replicate the effect reported in that study, whereby there
# was an interaction of WordType (arm vs leg verb) and MovementType (arm vs
# leg movements), leading to worse memory for arm than for leg verbs when
# performing arm movements and worse memory for leg than for arm verbs when
# performing leg movements.


# Estimates ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Reported results in S&P
# Mean number of errors by condition and word type (p.225):
# Foot/leg movements: leg words = 16.9, arm words = 13.1
# Hand/arm movements: leg words = 14.6, arm words = 16.5

# It is in fact unclear what the maximum number of errors was in each of the
# four cells above. There is some inconsistency both in how this is reported
# in the paper and in the clarifications they gave us via email (2018-04-01)
