## Power analysis for pilot study: a conceptual replication of Shebani & 
## Pulverm√ºller (2013, Cortex), henceforth S&P

# We will try to replicate the effect reported in that study, whereby there
# was an interaction of WordType (arm vs leg verb) and MovementType (arm vs
# leg movements), leading to worse memory for arm than for leg verbs when
# performing arm movements and worse memory for leg than for arm verbs when
# performing leg movements.

# Base estimates on S&P
