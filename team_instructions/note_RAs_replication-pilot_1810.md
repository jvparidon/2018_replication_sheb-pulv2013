Notes for RAs -- replication pilot
==================================

General
=======

- You should know what you have to do at each step. If something is unclear or
ambiguous, take it up with the project leader (PL) so that we all agree.
- It is easy to make errors (mix up participant numbers or conditions, saving
backups in the wrong format, etc.). If that happens, don't panic. Take it up
with the PL rather than trying to amend it by yourself. Inconsistencies or
idiosyncratic solutions usually create problems down the road. It's better to
document the mistakes and inform the PL, so they can be handled in a principled
way.


Recruiting native speakers
==========================

- Exchange / international / Erasmus student office at SU, KTH and KI: can they
send out a note?
- [Democrats abroad -- Sweden](https://www.democratsabroad.org/se)
- There are some English-speaking churches in town: one could ask the priest to
send out a note?

Specific
========

- Assign participants IDs in the range 700-799 (for piloting, use participant
IDs in the range 990-999)
- The session has to be either 1 or 2, and it is predetermined for each
participant ID. Check the "ID assignment form"!
