## round bc we added control condition, but I keep this script for reference.

## Script to generate experimental lists from the list of target verbs

# NB: Script is written to be sourced from the Rproject in the root directory
# of the project. All paths are relative to that root! (I.e., things will not
# work if script is called from the folder where it is actually located.)

getwd()  # should be "[whatever...]/2018_replication_sheb-pulv2013"


library(tidyverse)

# All files generated in this script go to the same folder, so save path as
# variable:
path_output <- "1908_sp13_replic_swe/psychopy_exp/stimuli/"


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Load data and process
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Target verbs
tv <- read_csv(paste(path_output, "sw_verb_selection_1906.csv", sep = "")) %>%
  select(type = category, verb = word)
head(tv)
  
# training verbs
tr <- read_csv(paste(path_output, "items_practice.csv", sep = ""))
head(tr)

# target verbs: processing and sanity checks
tv$verb <- tolower(trimws(tv$verb))  # trim whitespaces and use lower case
sum(table(tv$verb) != 1)  # Check no repeated verbs (value has to be zero!)
table(tv$type) %% 4 == 0  # Check number of arm/leg verbs are multiples of 4 (both TRUE)

# training verbs: processing and sanity checks
tr$verb <- tolower(trimws(tr$verb))  # trim whitespaces and use lower case
sum(table(tr$verb) != 1)  # Check no repeated verbs (value has to be zero!)
nrow(tr) %% 4 == 0  # Check is a multiple of 4 (TRUE)

#  Create 3 (pseudo-)random presentation lists of TARGETS for memory task
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# An item consists of a quadruple of words, i.e. a set of 4 words of the same 
# type. Since there are 52 arm and 52 leg words, we can form 26 unique items
# (13 arm items and 13 leg items).
# We will create 3 sets of items, i.e. 3 different groupings of the target words
# into items. We call each of these sets an item List (Lists A, B and C).
# Each participant will see 2 of these lists, one per block, which makes for
# 3 different combinations ({A,B},{A,C},{B,C}). In addition, they can see them
# in two orders, e.g. for {A,B}: A-B, B-A. Finally, participants can do the
# interference tasks (hand/feet paradiddle) in two orders: hands-feet or feet-hands.
# This means we want to create stimulus lists that are multiples of
# 12 = 3 (List identity) x 2 (List order) x 2 (condition order).
# The specific order in which the items are shown will be randomized between
# participants, with the constraint explained below.

## function to create a new set of random items, i.e. an item list

random_items <- function(df = tv) {
  # Put arm and leg words into a vector

#  Save target stimuli files for each participant and block
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NB: These are the files that will be read from the PsychoPy script

# Which list a participant sees in which block (1, 2) and whether that block is
# a arms/legs interference block is counterbalanced across participants.
# However, the *order* of the items within a block is randomized, with certain
# constraints: sequence of items within a block is random "with the  constraint
# that not more than three trials of the same word category appeared
# consecutively." (Shebani & PulvermÃ¼ller, 2013:225)

# The function that does this is valid_seq(), but I've factored it out into a
# separate script to keep things tidy here.
source("Rfunctions/randomise.R")  # see source code for details

# Function valid_seq() takes the items List dataframe by default and shuffles the
# rows until it finds an order that obeys the above constraint. It returns the
# reordered data frame. (Note that training items can be randomised in Psychopy,
# as no constraints apply in this case, so these will not be randomised by this
# function, but directly in PsychoPy instead)

valid_seq(random_items())  # the function is wordy...

x <- valid_seq(random_items())  
x  # but it only returns the valid data frame!


# To generate the final lists that a participant will see we use the following
# function. It makes sure that list identity (A,B,C), list order, and task order
# is counterbalanced (participant number should be a multiple of 12!).
# It then randomizes the items within a block and saves the final list to file.
