# The sequence of items presented in a block is random "with the 
# constraint that not more than three trials of the same word category appeared
# consecutively." (Shebani & PulvermÃ¼ller, 2013:225)

# reordered data frame. (Note that training items can be randomised in Psychopy,
# as no constraints apply in this case, so these will not be randomised by this
# function, but directly in PsychoPy instead)
