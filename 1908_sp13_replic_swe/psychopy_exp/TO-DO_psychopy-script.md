TO DO (sp13_replication_swe.psyexp)
===================================

Higher prio
===========


- Choose condition order depending on participant ID: Use the modulo/rest operator.
- Record sound from within psychopy
- Record ExpTime into output file



Paradiddle tap recording
---------------------

- Check with Jeroen: the pad only records taps during the 6 s memory phase, right? This means we don't know if Ss start too early.


Lower prio
============

## Simplify output data file

- Remove unnecessary (uninformative) columns in generated data files?


## Check for possible inconsistencies in the instructions to RAs (see team_instructions)

Go through them and perhaps merge?
