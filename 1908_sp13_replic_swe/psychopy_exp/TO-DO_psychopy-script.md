TO DO (sp13_replication_swe.psyexp)
===================================

Higher prio
===========

- Record sound from within psychopy
- Record ExpTime into output file



Paradiddle tap recording
---------------------

- Are the 2 MIDI devices consistently assigned to one port or does it depend on how/where they were plugged in? Check this so that the data is consistent.


Lower prio
============

## Simplify output data file

- Remove unnecessary (uninformative) columns in generated data files?


## Check for possible inconsistencies in the instructions to RAs (see team_instructions)

Go through them and perhaps merge?
