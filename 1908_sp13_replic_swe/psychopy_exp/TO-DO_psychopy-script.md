TO DO (sp13_replication_swe.psyexp)
===================================

Higher prio
===========

## Swedish instructions!


## Signal for Experimenter to check accuracy of paradiddles

- A flash (or something) that coincides with the offset of 4th word
- A counter for the trial to help filling in the "paradiddle error monitor form"


## Choice of words/stimuli

- Selection of Swedish verbs


## Create presentation lists with final set of target verbs

- Needs to be adjusted once we have final item lists (training + target); this choice will be based on our norming tasks in the pilot.
- Choose a convenient range of participant IDs


## Check for possible inconsistencies in the instructions to RAs (see team_instructions)

Go through them and perhaps merge?


## Power analysis to determine N


Lower prio
============

## Simplify output data file

Remove unnecessary (uninformative) columns in generated data files?
